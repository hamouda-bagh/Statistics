# Statistics
Pandas manipulation &amp; PCA

As part of the Statistics module studied at Tunisia Polytechnic School, I was assigned to practical works that consists of 3 numerical assignements.<br />
The first one an introduction to the python library Pandas and how to extract useful information from an excel data.<br />
The second one focused more on plotting various types of figures and trying to find patterns on the data.<br />
The last one is an application on an important method that is widely used in statistics: Principal Component Analysis.
